== Description ==
This plugin serves as a connector between [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) and [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/). It brings the Schema markup generated by The Events Calendar into the Yoast SEO Schema class and methodology for easier parsing by search engines.

If you are a developer, we encourage you to follow along or [contribute](https://github.com/luehrsenheinrich/yoast-schema-tribe-events) to the development of this plugin [on GitHub](https://github.com/luehrsenheinrich/yoast-schema-tribe-events).

= Features =

* Integrates the [Event Schema](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/event) from "The Events Calendar" into the standard of [Yoast SEO](https://yoast.com/schema-org-is-hard-were-making-it-easy/).
* Adds the ability to display Event Schema on the frontpage. (See the settings in "The Events Calendar")

= So what does this actually do? =

While "The Events Calendar" already outputs its own Schema markup, there are ways to make that markup even better. One of the ways is to integrate it into the Schema markup generated by Yoast SEO. And that is essentially what this plugin does.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Schema? =
Schema, as defined on schema.org, is a structured data vocabulary that defines entities, actions and relationships of data on the internet. In our case it helps search engines like Google understand some key information about the event, for example the starting time, the location and who performs at the event.

= Can I use this plugin without Yoast SEO or The Events Calender =
No. This plugin acts as a bridge between these two plugins. So while you could activate the plugin without any of the two, no action would be performed.

= How does this make my Schema better? =
This plugin takes the Schema information generated by The Events Calendar and enhances it with the help of tools provided by Yoast SEO. Using this plugin does not add any new information to the Schema, but it helps search engines to understand the relationships and context of your events a little bit better.

= Why should I use this plugin? =
If you are using both The Events Calender and Yoast SEO on your WordPress, using this plugin will make it easier for search engines to understand some key information about your event. Using it should give you a slight boost in terms of visibility of your events on search engines.
