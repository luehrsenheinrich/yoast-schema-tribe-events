== Description ==
This plugin serves as a connector between [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) and [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/). It brings the Schema markup generated by The Events Calendar into the Yoast SEO Schema class and methodology for easier parsing by search engines.

If you are a developer, we encourage you to follow along or [contribute](https://github.com/luehrsenheinrich/yoast-schema-tribe-events) to the development of this plugin [on GitHub](https://github.com/luehrsenheinrich/yoast-schema-tribe-events).

= Features =

* Integrates the [Event Schema](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/event) from "The Events Calendar" into the standard of [Yoast SEO](https://yoast.com/schema-org-is-hard-were-making-it-easy/).
* Adds the ability to display Event Schema on the frontpage. (See the settings in "The Events Calendar")

= So what does this actually do? =

While "The Events Calendar" already outputs its own Schema markup, there are ways to make that markup even better. One of the ways is to integrate it into the Schema markup generated by Yoast SEO. And that is essentially what this plugin does.

= What is Schema? =
Schema, as defined on schema.org, is a structured data vocabulary that defines entities, actions and relationships of data on the internet. In our case it helps search engines like Google understand some key information about the event, for example the starting time, the location and who performs at the event.
